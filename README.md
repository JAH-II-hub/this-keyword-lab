# CMPS2212 – Lab #3: The this Keyword & DOM Manipulation

This lab explores how the `this` keyword behaves in JavaScript event handlers.

## Exercises Completed

- Exercise 1 – Multi-Button Highlight using `this`
- Exercise 2 – Data Attribute Reader using `this.dataset`
- Exercise 3 – Counter App using `.bind()` to preserve object context
- Exercise 4 – Debugging arrow function and using `event.currentTarget`

## Key Concepts Learned

- How `this` depends on how a function is called
- Why arrow functions do not have their own `this`
- How `.bind()` locks context
- Difference between `event.target` and `event.currentTarget`

All exercises were tested in Chrome DevTools with no console errors.
